- **Hyundai online catalogs UX definition and development** 

Starting from pdf [offline catalogues](http://www.hyundai.es/catalogo/ioniqhibrido.pdf), the final goal was to make them interactive. My job here was to design the UI according to final user's behaviour and the client's global look and feel. I also developed the catalog, so I was the front-end behind the scenes here, working with HTML5, CSS3, Jquery and regarding the principles of the mobile-first design.[online catalog example](http://www.hyundai.es/catalogo/digital/ioniq)
